A Neovim plugin that help you to set your current working directory. By
default, this plugin will set the parent directory of the first open file as
the current working directory as you fresh start Neovim.

You can later set your current working directory by using |origin.set_root| or
permanently change the default root directory by customising the variable
|origin.default_source|.

                                                             *origin.command*

origin()                                                      *origin.origin*
:Origin                                                             *:Origin*
	Print the current working directory, similarly |pwd| in Vim. You could
	call this function with Vim command or Neovim Lua command.

set_root{dir, manual = false}                               *origin.set_root*
:OriginSetDefaultRoot                                  *OriginSetDefaultRoot*
:OriginSetManualRoot                                    *OriginSetManualRoot*
	Manually set current working directory according to the arguments or
	which Vim command is called. If the `manual` is false or
	`OriginSetDefaultRoot` is called, the current working directory will
	be set according to 'dir' and the logic specified by
	|origin.default_source|. If the `manual` is true or
	`OriginSetManualRoot` is called, the current working directory will be
	set to `dir`. Both Vim commands accept only 1 arguments.

default_source{}                                      *origin.default_source*
	Set the operational logic of |origin.set_root| or
	|:OriginSetDefaultRoot| to set the root directory by passing a table
	consists of directory/ies that should be the sub-directory/ies for the
	project root.

	Usage:

>
	require('origin').default_source {
  	lua = "lua",
  	c = { "src", "lib", "test" },
	}
